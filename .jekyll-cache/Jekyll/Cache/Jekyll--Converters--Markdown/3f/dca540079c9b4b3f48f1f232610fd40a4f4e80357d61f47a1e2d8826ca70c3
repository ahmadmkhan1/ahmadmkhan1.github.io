I"w<p>I was casually messing around with this nice looking DLP agent, Endpoint Protector by CoSoSys when I realized the power of having Local Admin on a machine.</p>

<p><strong>Its Deadly.</strong></p>

<p><em>Trust me, it is. It is so deadly that it can kill a Dragon.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So, I had it installed on one of my machines and remotely pushed a policy to deny any attached USB. It worked like a charm and all my USB ports got blocked. Afterwards, I tried uninstalling the agent directly from the machine but I was denied operation. I tried uninstalling it as local admin, but even that didn’t work out as the Endpoint Protector requires an OTP provided by its remote administrator.</p>

<p>And that is where the FUN began.</p>

<p>I went to the installation directory of the Endpoint Protector agent <em>C:\Program Files\CoSoSys\Endpoint Protector</em> and moved the following two files out of this directory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EPPService.dll</li>
  <li>EPPService.exe</li>
</ul>

<p>When I attempted to move these files, my machine asked me for administrative access where I simply gave my local admin credentials. But the files didn’t get moved from the directory. Instead, it kept showing me this dialog box</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I went to the task manager and tried to stop EPPservice.exe as a normal user but it restarted itself in 4-5 seconds. I stopped it again and then quickly clicked try again on the <em>File In Use</em> dialog box.</p>

<p>Voila. I then forced reboot the machine and found that neither EPP ran on startup nor any policy implemented through it. All of this happened because I had local admin on the machine who was able to move the executable and the DLL file required by EPP for running.</p>

<p>So what can be the solution to this?</p>

<p><strong>In environments where active directory has been setup, it is always a good practice to disable local admin.</strong></p>
