I"Ï<p>During an incident response, I felt the need to parse Windows Event Logs and send them to ELK for analysis.</p>

<p>I tried a few parsers like <a href="https://github.com/dgunter/evtxtoelk"><em>evtxtoelk by dgunter</em></a> which is a good tool but it often misses some event logs while pushing them to ELK. Another nice option was <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/winlogbeat"><em>winlogbeat</em></a> by elastic which installs itself as a service on the system and keeps pushing the logs to ELK. I noticed a drawback that it sometimes either misses some logs or sends incomplete info of a log.</p>

<p>I needed to push logs with high accuracy and most importantly something that I could trust, so  wrote a python script keeping in mind we donâ€™t miss any logs :)</p>

<p>I call it <a href="https://github.com/EbryxLabs/__DFIR-scripts/tree/master/Excavator"><em>Excavator</em></a>. The tool is now actively maintained by EbryxLabs. Feel free to use it.</p>
